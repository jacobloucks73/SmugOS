Hello All!

This project is more a excursion into the operating system world, hopefully not one like Terry Davis'. 

The goals of this project is to build a OS that is all of the following:

1. Well documented unlike the other github OS's I've seen.
2. Able to run on the Raspberry Pi(at least the 4B).
3. Able to run on x86 processors.
4. have fun and master c programming.


sprint 0(SETUP):

COMPLETED 

10/30/2025 11:15am    -    10/31/2025 2:15am

The goals of this sprint were to get knowledge of the steps involved in setting up the development enviroment

Accomplished:

1. Got the DSL Iso running on QEMU in the debian 13 VM
2. got the github repo initialized  and public(hi)
3. made agile sprint template and backlog file for eventual backlog once the research sprint is started


sprint  1(Research and Minimal Viable Product):  

IN PROGRESS

10/31/2025 2:15am    -   

The goals of this sprint were to:

1. make a fuctional bootloader
2. make a kernal entry file
3. make a MVP kernel to output minimal output
4. make a linker script
5. make a makefile to make the above into a bootable image
6. make a bootable iso that outputs the kernels minimal response

the end goal is to have a deliverable iso that is recreatable on outside machines(QEMU)
