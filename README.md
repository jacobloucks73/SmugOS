Hello All!

This project is more a excursion into the operating system world, hopefully not one like Terry Davis'. 

The goals of this project is to build a OS that is all of the following:

1. Well documented unlike the other github OS's I've seen.
2. Able to run on the Raspberry Pi(at least the 4B).
3. Able to run on x86 processors.
4. have fun and master c programming.
